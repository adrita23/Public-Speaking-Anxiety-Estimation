# Public-Speaking-Anxiety-Estimation


Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is among the top social phobias in the world. To quantify PSA in a reliable manner can lay the foundation toward personalized interventions. We study this problem with bio-behavioral features, temporal data- EDA, HR. Estimation of PSA with temporal models and comparison of  the performance with non-temporal models is the primary goal of the study. We  further investigate the interpretability of the models with LIME and  explore variations between native and non-native group of people .

The project has the following steps.

### 1. Data Pre-processing and Exploration
### 2. Feature Selection
### 3. Feature Transformation
### 4. Time Series Data Analysis (FNN, RNN, lSTM) on Heart Data, Electrdermal Activity Data
### 5. Interpretability with Explainable AI (LIME)
### 6. Examining Individual Differences between groups
